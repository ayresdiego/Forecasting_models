## Outlier Detector 

> Find outliers in your X training dataset. Applying this methodology in predicting models the accuracy and mean absolute error tends to be more robust

- Minimum Covariance Determinant (MCD) - detect outliers in multivariate data
- Multivariate DataFrame with Normal Distribution
- Increase Prediction model accuracy  

**Required libraries**: *sklearn, numpy ,pandas*
